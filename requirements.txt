# The 'tirex' library is used by the forecasting adapter but is not a hard
# requirement. The adapter will fall back to a stub if it is not installed.
# To use it, you must install it separately from its source repository:
# https://github.com/NX-AI/tirex
#
# You can uncomment the line below if you have git installed and wish to
# install it directly, though manual installation is recommended.
